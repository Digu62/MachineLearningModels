# Contextualization
> The Mnist Digits dataset is a challenge when we have a collection of images with handmaded numbers from 0 to 9. 

# Challenge
> The challenge consists in create a machine learning model to predict wich is the number in each imagen provided.

# Data
> The data containt 785 columns, where the first columns has the label and the other 784 columns the pixel values from the image. So, each sample is a image 28x28 pixels in gray scale (0 to 255).

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement folder creation in script code
- [x] Implement machine learning algorithm
- [ ] Train and test model
- [ ] Save results
- [ ] Analyse results
- [ ] Improve model
