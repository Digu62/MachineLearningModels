# Contextualization
> The iris flower dataset is a challenge when we have tre types of flower the "Iris Virginica", "Iris Setona" and "Iris Versicolor", each flower has diferent width and length from his sepal and petal, and can be differentiated according to these attributes

# Challenge
> The challenge here is propose a machine learning model able to differentiate the flowers receiving their sepal and petal width and length. 

# Data
> The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).
